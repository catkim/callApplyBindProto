# callApplyBindProto

I made this repo to go over Call, Apply, Bind and Prototypical Inheritance in simple terms using object literals because I mostly work with simple objects. I've been using these methods for years and understood the concept of explicitly setting "this" using call.  I also knew that you can use call to convert a collection of HTML elements to array like this:
let buttonsArray = [].slice.call(document.querySelectAll('button'))

To me it was a bit confusing seeing call used in both ways. I wanted to feel more confident using these methods so I did some reading, watched some great videos, and played around with code until I felt I had a more solid understanding.  Hopefully you will too after looking over my code and I'll leave the links to the videos.
